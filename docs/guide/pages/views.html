  <h1>Views</h1>
  <p>
    [%= project %] views exist to interact with the DOM. A view has an <em>el</em> by which all DOM manipulation, creation, and observation is conducted.
    Views are equipped with an <em>emitter</em> which is a simple pubsub interface. It's existence is vital to the usability of views in [%= project %]. Without it, you end up with random callbacks, assumptions about child implementations, and overall horrible architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    [%= project %] comes equipped with a few different types of views:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>pie.view</code>
      <span>- a simple DOM wrapper enabling management of events, observation of models, etc.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>pie.activeView</code>
      <span>- a pie.view with templating functionality. More on templating later.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>pie.formView</code>
      <span>- a pie.activeView designed to standardize and enhance the behavior of forms.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>pie.view</h3>
  <p>
    <code>pie.view</code> is the most rudimentary implementation of DOM management in [%= project %]. It's purpose is to provide a way to easily and efficiently query, observe, and update DOM.
  </p>

  [%= h.gist("view.js") %]

  <h3>pie.formView</h3>
