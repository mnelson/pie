  <h1>Models</h1>
  <p>
    [%= project %] models provide a simple interface for object management and observation. They even provide computed properties, just like Ember models.
  </p>

  <h3>Model Basics</h3>
  <p>
    Model activity is managed through getters and setters, resembling the native Object.observe functionality. Each model contains a <em>data</em> object which the getters and setters manipulate. You can bootstrap a model with data by providing it to the constructor
  </p>

  [%= h.gist("modelAccessors.js") %]

  <p>[%= project %] models allow for path management as well.</p>

  [%= h.gist("modelPaths.js") %]

  <h3>Computed Properties</h3>
  <p>Models are given the ability to define properties which are computed based on other properties of the model. This is accomplished via the <em>compute</em> method.</p>

  [%= h.gist("modelComputed.js") %]

  <p>The <em>compute</em> method accepts the property name, functional definition, and the dependent properties (or paths). If the functional definition is ommitted, a function of the provided name will be retrieved from the instance itself. This is useful when dealing with inheritance.</p>

  [%= h.gist("modelComputed2.js") %]

  <h3>Observation</h3>
  <p>Attributes, paths, and subpaths of a model can be observed. Observers are invoked after a <em>set</em>, <em>sets</em>, or <em>merge</em> operation is conducted. When invoked, observers receive an array of change records. The array is enhanced with extra functionality as defined by the <em>changeSet</em> mixin.</p>

  [%= h.gist("modelObserver.js") %]

  <h5>Special Observations</h5>
  <p>Observations come in a couple different forms which, if used correctly, really helps performance.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Empty observation:&nbsp;</strong>
        <code>model.observe(fn)</code>
        <br />
        <span>By omitting the 2nd+ argument(s) you're opting into an observer which doesn't care about change records. Change records will note be compiled for this observer.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Full path observation:&nbsp;</strong>
        <code>model.observe(fn, 'foo.bar')</code>
        <br />
        <span>By providing a specific path that matches a non-POJO value, you are telling the model to compile change records for only the path you've provided.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Subpath observation:&nbsp;</strong>
        <code>model.observe(fn, 'foo')</code>
        <br />
        <span>By providing a specific path that matches a POJO value, you are saying that you care about changes within the object, but don't care about the specifics alterations.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Glob observations:&nbsp;</strong>
        <code>model.observe(fn, 'foo.*')</code>
        <br />
        <span>By providing a glob, you're opting into receiving a change record for each alteration within an object. The number of callback invocations will be identical to the "Subpath observation" but the ChangeSet will be potentially much larger.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>ChangeSets</h5>

  <p>When an observer is triggered it's always provided with a changeSet object. This object is an array, with some extra functionality. Here's what you can do with a changeSet.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>*</code>
      <span>- every Array.prototype function.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>get(key)</code>
      <span>- access the most recent change record associated with the given key.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>has(key)</code>
      <span>- does the changeSet contain a record with the given key.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>hasAny(*keys)</code>
      <span>- are there any change records that match any of the given keys?</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>hasAll(*keys)</code>
      <span>- are all of the provided keys present in the given change records?</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>query(options)</code>
      <span>- query for the latest change set by name and/or type.</span>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li><code>changeSet.query({name: "firstName", type: "update"})</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>queryAll(options)</code>
      <span>- query for all change records matching the name and/or type.</span>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li><code>changeSet.queryAll({type: "update"})</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
