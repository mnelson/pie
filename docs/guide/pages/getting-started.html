  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>
    The first step to building an app with <em>[%= project %]</em> is defining your app instance.
    The app instance contains the services which manage the high level interactions with the browser. Services like
    <em>pushState</em>, <em>localStorage</em>, <em>ajax</em>, <em>i18n</em>, and <em>routing</em>.
  </p>

  [%= h.gist('appInstance.js') %]

  <p>
    This is the focal point of your application. When the <em>DOMContentLoaded</em> event is fired, your application will begin managing it's state. Instantiation of a <em>[%= ns %].app</em> results in the instantiation of many services. If you need to provide options to one of these services, you simply provide the service's name + <em>Options</em> to the app's options. For instance, to provide options to the router, your would:
  </p>

  [%= h.gist('appInstanceWithRouterOptions.js') %]

  <p>If, however, you have implemented your own version of a service, you can provide the class or instance directly:</p>

  [%= h.gist('appInstanceWithRouterClass.js') %]

  <p>Similarly, if you want to opt out of including a service, you can supply <em>false</em> as the option:</p>

  [%= h.gist('appInstanceWithRouterFalse.js') %]

  <h3>App state</h3>

  <p>The most core element of the [%= project %] framework is the <em>appState</em> object. It holds information about what the app should be rendering at any given time. By default, the browser's path + query are combined to generate unique states. That said, if you decide to opt out of a navigator via a <code>navigator: false</code> option, your appState will have nothing to do with the browser. Here's this app's current state:</p>

  <code class="hljs">
    <pre>[%= hljs.highlight('json', JSON.stringify(pie.object.merge({}, app.state.data, {__route: 'CurrentRouteInstance'}), null, 2)).value %]</pre>
  </code>

  <h3>Handling State Changes</h3>

  <p>Each app optionally has a router at <em>app.router</em>. It is used to map state identifiers to declared routes within your app. When the state is about to change, it is given the opportunity to modify the changes that will be made to your state object. By default, if a route matches the new identifier, it is added as the <code>__route</code> key.</p>

  <p>A separate object, our <em>app.routeHandler</em> watches for route changes and manages the top level view in your dom. By default the app.routeHandler will look for a <code>view</code> key in your route and instantiate the view defined at <code>lib.views.#{view}</code>.</p>

  <p>If you have an <em>app.navigator</em> defined in your app, it will observe changes in browser state via the history api and tell the app to change it's state. Similarly, it will observe changes to app.state and update the browser via the history api.</p>

  [%= h.gist('routerMappings.js') %]

  <h3>Simple Example App</h3>
  <p>This example app shows how an app is created, two routes are mapped, and views are declared.</p>
