  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    The first step to building an app with <em>[%= project %]</em> is defining your app instance.
    The app instance contains the services which manage the high level interactions with the browser. Services like
    <em>pushState</em>, <em>localStorage</em>, <em>ajax</em>, <em>i18n</em>, and <em>routing</em>.
  </p>
  <x-gist gist="[%= app.i18n.t('gist') %]" filename="appInstance.js"></x-gist>
  <p>
    This is the focal point of your application. When the <em>DOMContentLoaded</em> event is fired, your application will begin managing it's state.
  </p>
