  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    The first step to building an app with <em>[%= project %]</em> is defining your app instance.
    The app instance contains the services which manage the high level interactions with the browser. Services like
    <em>pushState</em>, <em>localStorage</em>, <em>ajax</em>, <em>i18n</em>, and <em>routing</em>.
